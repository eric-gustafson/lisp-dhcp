#+title: work

* TODO encode/decode dhcp options
  [[file:../devdocs/dhcp-options.org]]

  Use a document sexp approach to these calculations

* TODO send dhcp response message back
  This is a DHCP-OFFER
  

** TODO create a commissioning network
   This is a virtual interface with a network allocated from *network-malloc*


*** TODO verfify that this shows up on RBPI

*** TODO up/down this network
    (defmethod net-up ((obj netobj))
     )

    
*** TODO allocate IP and network info



** TODO simple/dumb dhcp address allocation
   incf for now

* TODO look at erlang dhcp server I did a couple of years ago
  <2019-05-19 Sun> Not that bad, actually.  Stuff to learn from @ the very least

** TODO move netsecurity.org document for erlang dhcp project here
   It was all there, except for the actual way to stop x-talk on the wireless lan (seperate networks for each node)


* TODO capture packets and start a database of dhcp interactions


* TODO Add a section to construct a reply
  Use the *commissioning-network* info above

* TODO change the print-object to display mac address
  mac address should use the 'size' operator which is one of the first parameters
  which then allows us to trim the chaddr field.

* TODO remote slime to rbpi repl
  ssh proxy


* TODO add support for different types of strings
  When generating code from the org-babel tables, handle the following
  strings by adding more keywords

  - fixed
  - pascal
  - c



* Archive
** DONE Use cl-async?
   Figure out if we really want to do this.  Why not just use select?
   In the future, we can inhance by creating an event using the file
   descriptor


** DONE Receive and decode dhcp broadcast
   To send and receive broadcast

*** netmask
    Be sure that netmask is correct. in windows mask for broadcast
     packets does not matters, but not in linux.

*** wildcard address
    bind socket to INADDR_ANY

*** setsockopt
    setsockopt to BROADCAST

*** sendto
    call sendto with sendaddr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("your_interface_broadcast_address")

    call sento several times for each interface with its broadcast ip address.

*** call recvfrom. any time before calling recvfrom, set up length parameter


** DONE bring up 2nd interface from rbpi
   These things are currently in snot.  Should we move?

** DONE lisp-lsa package
   A lisp linux bases system administsration package focusing on wifi

   Have a wifi.lisp as one of the files
