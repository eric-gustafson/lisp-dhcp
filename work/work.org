* TODO Receive and decode dhcp broadcast
  To send and receive broadcast

** netmask
   Be sure that netmask is correct. in windows mask for broadcast
    packets does not matters, but not in linux.

** wildcard address
   bind socket to INADDR_ANY

** setsockopt
   setsockopt to BROADCAST

** sendto
   call sendto with sendaddr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("your_interface_broadcast_address")

   call sento several times for each interface with its broadcast ip address.

** call recvfrom. any time before calling recvfrom, set up length parameter

  
* TODO allocate IP and network info

* TODO Use cl-async?
  Figure out if we really want to do this.  Why not just use select?
  In the future, we can inhance by creating an event using the file
  descriptor



* TODO Add a section to deconstruct the captured packet

* TODO Add a section to construct a reply

* TODO add files to command line program
