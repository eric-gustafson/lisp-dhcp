#+title: work


* TODO dhcp network based ip allocation code

* TODO I'm giving out the router address as the ip address

* TODO have everything come up from a boot

* TODO get routing working

* TODO Have the program install everything to run as a daemon
  

* TODO create a commissioning network
  This is a virtual interface with a network allocated from *network-malloc*


** TODO verfify that this shows up on RBPI

** TODO up/down this network
   (defmethod net-up ((obj netobj))
    )

   
** TODO allocate IP and network info



** TODO simple/dumb dhcp address allocation
   incf for now


* TODO Receive and decode dhcp broadcast
  To send and receive broadcast

** netmask
   Be sure that netmask is correct. in windows mask for broadcast
    packets does not matters, but not in linux.

** wildcard address
   bind socket to INADDR_ANY

** setsockopt
   setsockopt to BROADCAST

** sendto
   call sendto with sendaddr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("your_interface_broadcast_address")

   call sento several times for each interface with its broadcast ip address.

** call recvfrom. any time before calling recvfrom, set up length parameter




* TODO move netsecurity.org document for erlang dhcp project here
  It was all there, except for the actual way to stop x-talk on the wireless lan (seperate networks for each node)



* TODO Add a section to construct a reply
  Use the *commissioning-network* info above

* TODO change the print-object to display mac address
  mac address should use the 'size' operator which is one of the first parameters
  which then allows us to trim the chaddr field.
