#+title: Medium Term Plan

* Goals

  To have a programmable dhcp server.


* Milestones

** Real DHCP and routing for RBPI

** Automated Xen network deployments
   
*** Use cases
    - Configure a new subnet with a router and 100 clients, where each client is a new Ubuntu


** Provide DHCP and routing services for a Xen Client

** newer versions of RBPI support PXE boots
   This is our over-the-air update.  



* hostapd 

* dhcp-discover
** give ip on staging network
   Low lease, very little bandwidth
** security challenge
   nmap device, get mac address, is there a profile for this device?

** Create a network, apply profiles for this device
*** IP aliasing on wlan0


* Staging Network
  dhcp-request => 1 minute lease
  nmap node => assign profile
  Create a new network
  dhcp-renew => give new ip/network
