* Goal
  A research project to explore what can be done with a programable
  dhcp server

** Network Security
   Have a network default to not allowing cross talk between nodes.
   The dhcp server automatically creates an interface at the router
   for each device.  Routing between devices will have to be turned
   on, and a signature must be matched, say from an active nmap scan
   or from a passive traffic discovery.

** Xen setups

** Mesh networking
   Programmatically route traffic to other nodes on network based on
   netmask.
